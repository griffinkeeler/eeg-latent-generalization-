# Evaluating How Latent Dimensionality Affects Cross-Subject Generalization in EEG
___

## Overview 
___
Decoding EEG signals across different subjects is challenging due to the variance of neural signals and the noisy nature of EEG. 
Recent machine-learning methods have addressed the challenges of generalization
by encoding latent representations to generate semantic EEG signals. However, evaluating how the dimensionality of the latent 
space affects cross-subject generalization is largely unstudied. In the project, I will study the robustness of
various latent dimensions across subjects. 

## Representation Learning Using EEGDM
___
I will use the EEG Diffusion Model (EEGDM) developed by Chang et al. [1] to effectively learn latent representations of the EEG signal.
